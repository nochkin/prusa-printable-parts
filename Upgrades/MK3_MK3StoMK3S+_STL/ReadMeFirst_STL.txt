Original Prusa i3 MK3/MK3S to MK3S+ upgrade 
-------------------------------------------

Below is a list of parts needed for the upgrade, choose your current printer and then the one you are upgrading to. Note that some parts are included in the upgrade package as it is difficult to print them yourself.

We recommend using black filament to print all MK3S+ extruder parts. If you want different colour, you can use it, but the FS-lever part should be definitely dark (black) and the other parts surrounding the IR-Sensor as well. In case you use any lighter colour for the FS-lever it might not trigger the sensor.

All the packages are available for download at: https://www.prusa3d.com/prusa-i3-printable-parts/
