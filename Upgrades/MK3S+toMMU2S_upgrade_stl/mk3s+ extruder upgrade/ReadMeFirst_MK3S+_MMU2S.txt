Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ MMU2S upgrade - V1.0
----------------------------------------------------

Below is a list of parts need for the upgrade. All the packages are available for download at: https://www.prusa3d.com/prusa-i3-printable-parts/
 
MMU2S owners:
Use the FS-cover part you already have installed on your printer it is compatible with the latest design. Printing a new one will require you to get the brass nut with thread and insert it using heat, which isn't recommended.
In case you have ordered the MMU2S package, all the "upper" extruder parts required for the MMU2S will be included. No need to print them.
